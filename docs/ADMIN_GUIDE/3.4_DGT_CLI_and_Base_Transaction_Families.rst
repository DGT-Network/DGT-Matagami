3.4	DGT CLI and Base Transaction Families
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each node has a CLI (Command Line Interface) service as a component. To run the CLI, you need to access the bash shell inside the container:

    .. code-block:: python 

        docker exec -it shell-dgt-c1-1 bash

Inside, it is possible to enter commands regarding the node's status and the testing families of transactions. Different families of commands may have some differences in options; here is a general view based on the dgt transaction family:
